### [DID Key Method Specification](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key)

`did:key` is a [DID Method](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) which is offline friendly, cryptographically self certifying, requires no trust of blockchain or certificate authoritites and is ideal for ephemeral use.

ðŸš§ Under Construction.

## Release process

### Unstable releases

Unstable releases are automatic, from CD:

- On every commit to master an unstable release is pushed. An unstable release is a release with a tag of the form: vA.B.C-unstable.X. Everytime a PR is merged, X is incremented.
- If "skip-ci" is present in the commit message, the aforementioned behavior is skipped

### Stable releases

Stable releases are triggered by a dev locally

- Make sure you are familiar with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Run `npm install` and `npm build` in the root level directory
- Run
  - `npm run publish:stable:patch` for a patch version increment
  - `npm run publish:stable:minor` for a minor version increment
  - `npm run publish:stable:major` for a major version increment

### Example

- Current version is v0.1.0
- A PR is made to fix bug A. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-0
- A PR is made to add feature B. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-1
- A PR is made to add feature C. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-2
- Dev runs `npm run publish:stable:patch`. Current version is v0.1.0
- A PR is made to fix bug D. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.1-unstable-0
- etc...

### Deployment

```
npm run deploy
```

Because `did:key` is just a deterministic transformer of public key bytes...

You really ought to never resolve it over a network.

However, it can be useful for testing purposes.

In order to avoid costs, recommend a hosting provider that is free / rate limited.

glitch.com is one such provider... firebase used to be ðŸ˜¢

#####

1.  Create a new glitch.com project.
2.  Allow git pushes for the project.

Tools > Terminal

```
git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
```

3. Get the project git url

Tools > Import & Export > Project_Git_URL

4. Set the project as a submodule

```
git submodule add <Project_Git_URL> glitch-hosting
```

5. Make some changes and push

6. Refresh glitch project to see changes.

Tools > Terminal

```
refresh
```

7. Setup npm scripts to automate deployments according to your preferences.
