### [DID Key Method Specification](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-key)

`did:key` is a [DID Method](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) which is offline friendly, cryptographically self certifying, requires no trust of blockchain or certificate authoritites and is ideal for ephemeral use.

ðŸš§ Under Construction.

#### [https://did.key.transmute.industries](https://did.key.transmute.industries).

Because `did:key` is just a deterministic transformation of public key bytes
, you really ought to never resolve it over a network.

#### [did-key.js](./packages/did-key.js)

```
npm i @transmute/did-key.js@latest
```

This module contains all did-key implementations we current support.

Unless you really intend to use all of them, we suggest installing just the ones you need.

## Release process

### Unstable releases

Unstable releases are automatic, from CD:

- On every commit to main an unstable release is pushed. An unstable release is a release with a tag of the form: vA.B.C-unstable.X. Everytime a PR is merged, X is incremented.
- If "skip-ci" is present in the commit message, the aforementioned behavior is skipped

### Stable releases

Stable releases are triggered by a dev locally

- Make sure you are familiar with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Run `npm install` and `npm build` in the root level directory
- Run
  - `npm run publish:stable:patch` for a patch version increment
  - `npm run publish:stable:minor` for a minor version increment
  - `npm run publish:stable:major` for a major version increment

### Example

- Current version is v0.1.0
- A PR is made to fix bug A. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-0
- A PR is made to add feature B. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-1
- A PR is made to add feature C. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.0-unstable-2
- Dev runs `npm run publish:stable:patch`. Current version is v0.1.0
- A PR is made to fix bug D. When it's merged a release is made: v0.1.1-unstable-0
- etc...

### Usage

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run install:only @transmute/did-key-x25519
```

To run tests in every packages run
